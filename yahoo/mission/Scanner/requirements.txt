# GoPiGo Scanner Requirements
# This scanner is GoPiGo robot only - requires Raspberry Pi

# Core dependencies
opencv-python-headless>=4.5.0  # For camera and image processing (works with old picamera library)
python-dotenv>=0.19.0          # For .env file support (optional)

# GoPiGo dependencies (required on robot)
easygopigo3>=1.0.0              # For GoPiGo LEDs

# Optional: PiCamera2 (not required - scanner uses OpenCV VideoCapture)
# picamera2>=0.3.0               # Optional: Can be installed if preferred, but not needed

# Note: Scanner uses OpenCV VideoCapture directly (same approach as gesture detection).
# Works with the old picamera library that's already installed on the Pi.
