# GoPiGo Scanner Requirements
# This scanner is GoPiGo robot only - requires Raspberry Pi

# Core dependencies
opencv-python-headless>=4.5.0  # For camera and image processing
python-dotenv>=0.19.0          # For .env file support (optional)

# GoPiGo dependencies (required on robot)
easygopigo3>=1.0.0              # For GoPiGo LEDs

# Note: Scanner uses OpenCV VideoCapture with CSI_CAMERA config
# No picamera2 needed - uses existing camera infrastructure
