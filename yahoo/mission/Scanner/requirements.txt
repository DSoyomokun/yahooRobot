# GoPiGo Scanner Requirements
# This scanner is GoPiGo robot only - requires Raspberry Pi

# Core dependencies
opencv-python-headless>=4.5.0  # For camera and image processing
python-dotenv>=0.19.0          # For .env file support (optional)

# GoPiGo dependencies (required on robot)
picamera2>=0.3.0               # Preferred for CSI camera (auto-detected, falls back to OpenCV if not available)
easygopigo3>=1.0.0              # For GoPiGo LEDs

# Note: Scanner automatically uses picamera2 for CSI camera if available,
# otherwise falls back to OpenCV VideoCapture
