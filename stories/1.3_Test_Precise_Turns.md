# Story 1.3: Test & Refine Precise Turns

**Epic:** 1 - Foundation & Core Navigation

**Description:**
Create a test script to validate the robot's ability to perform accurate turns in place. This is critical for navigating between waypoints. This will use the existing turning logic that relies on the IMU.

**Tasks:**
1.  Identify the function/method in the `yahoo/nav/` codebase responsible for turning a set number of degrees.
2.  Create a new test script: `tests/test_turns.py`.
3.  The script should contain separate test cases for:
    *   A 90-degree right turn.
    *   A 90-degree left turn.
    *   A 180-degree turn.
4.  For each case, the script should command the robot to turn and then read the final heading from the IMU.
5.  The script should log the initial and final heading for debugging.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- A test script `tests/test_turns.py` is created.
- The robot can execute a 90-degree turn and stop with its final heading at 90 +/- 3 degrees relative to the start.
- The robot can execute a 180-degree turn and stop with its final heading at 180 +/- 3 degrees relative to the start.
- The test script prints a "SUCCESS" or "FAILURE" message for each turn type based on whether the final heading is within tolerance.
