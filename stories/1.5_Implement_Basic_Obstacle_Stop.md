# Story 1.5: Implement Basic Obstacle Stop ✅ COMPLETE

**Epic:** 1 - Foundation & Core Navigation

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - Advanced obstacle avoidance implemented in `main.py`

**Description:**
Integrate the Time-of-Flight (ToF) distance sensor as a fundamental safety feature. While the robot is executing any movement, it should continuously check the sensor, and if an obstacle is detected too close, it must stop immediately.

**Tasks:**
1.  ✅ Identify the existing code for reading the ToF sensor (likely in `yahoo/sense/`).
2.  ✅ Modify the core movement functions (for both linear movement and turns) to include a "safety check" loop.
3.  ✅ This loop should run concurrently with the movement command, polling the ToF sensor.
4.  ✅ If the sensor reading is below a defined threshold (e.g., 20 cm), the function must immediately command the robot's motors to stop.
5.  ✅ Add logging to indicate when an obstacle has been detected.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ During the execution of continuous movement, placing an object directly in front of the robot causes it to stop all motor activity immediately.
- ✅ A log message indicating obstacle detection is printed to the console.
- ✅ The robot handles obstacle avoidance intelligently.

**Implementation Notes:**
The current implementation in `main.py` (lines 311-462) goes **beyond** the original story requirements:
- ✅ Detects obstacles using GoPiGo Distance Sensor (ToF)
- ✅ Stops immediately when obstacle detected
- ✅ Performs intelligent obstacle avoidance maneuver (goes around)
- ✅ Uses IMU for path recovery to return to original trajectory
- ✅ Resumes forward movement after clearing obstacle
- ✅ Comprehensive logging of obstacle detection and avoidance

This advanced implementation will be leveraged for navigation in Stories 1.2-1.4 and delivery/collection missions.
