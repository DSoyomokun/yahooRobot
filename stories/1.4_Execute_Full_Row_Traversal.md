# Story 1.4: Execute a Full Row Traversal

**Epic:** 1 - Foundation & Core Navigation

**Description:**
Write a high-level script that integrates the previous stories to make the robot traverse the entire path for the row of desks. This script will act as the first end-to-end test of the core navigation system.

**Tasks:**
1.  Create a new script: `scripts/run_row_traversal.py`.
2.  This script will first load the desk layout from the configuration file (Story 1.1).
3.  It will then implement a loop to visit each desk:
    *   Calculate the required turn and distance to get from the current position to the next waypoint (desk or origin).
    *   Call the movement functions (from Story 1.2 and 1.3) to execute the movement.
    *   Log progress, such as "Navigating to Desk 1..." and "Arrived at Desk 1."
4.  The path should be: Origin -> Desk 1 -> Desk 2 -> ... -> Last Desk -> Origin.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- A script `scripts/run_row_traversal.py` is created.
- When executed, the robot successfully navigates to each desk waypoint defined in the config file in sequence.
- The robot stops briefly at each waypoint.
- The robot successfully returns to the origin point at the end of the traversal.
- The script prints clear log messages indicating its current goal and status.
