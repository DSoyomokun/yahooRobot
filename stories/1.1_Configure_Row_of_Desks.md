# Story 1.1: Configure the "Row of Desks"

**Epic:** 1 - Foundation & Core Navigation

**Description:**
Adapt the existing `yahoo/config/rooms.json` or create a new `row_config.json` to define the simplified layout of the single row of desks. This configuration will serve as the "map" for all navigation tasks.

**Tasks:**
1.  Investigate `yahoo/config/rooms.json` to understand its structure.
2.  Decide whether to adapt `rooms.json` or create a new, simpler `row_config.json`.
3.  Define the coordinates for the robot's "origin" (start/end point) and each desk location in the row. The structure should be a simple list of waypoints.
    *   Example: `{"origin": [0, 0], "desks": [[1.0, 0], [2.0, 0], [3.0, 0]]}` (assuming desks are 1m apart in a straight line).
4.  Create a simple Python script to load and parse this configuration.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- A JSON configuration file exists that defines the row layout.
- A test script (`tests/test_config_loader.py`) can be run that successfully loads the configuration and prints the parsed desk coordinates and origin point without errors.
