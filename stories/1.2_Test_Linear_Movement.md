# Story 1.2: Test & Refine Linear Movement

**Epic:** 1 - Foundation & Core Navigation

**Description:**
Create a dedicated test script to validate and, if necessary, refine the robot's ability to drive straight for a specified distance. This will rely on adapting the existing navigation logic that uses the IMU for heading correction.

**Tasks:**
1.  Identify the function/method in the existing `yahoo/nav/` codebase responsible for driving forward a set distance.
2.  Create a new test script: `tests/test_linear_movement.py`.
3.  The script should call the driving function to move the robot forward a specific distance (e.g., 1 meter).
4.  During movement, the script should log the robot's heading from the IMU at regular intervals (e.g., 10 times per second).
5.  After the movement is complete, the script should analyze the logs to verify the heading remained within tolerance.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- A test script `tests/test_linear_movement.py` is created.
- When run, the robot drives forward 1 meter and stops.
- The robot's heading, as recorded in the logs, stays within a +/- 2 degree tolerance from its starting heading throughout the movement.
- The robot stops within a reasonable distance of the target (e.g., +/- 5 cm).
