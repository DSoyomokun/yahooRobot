## ⚡ Development Aliases

**Quick setup:** Run `./scripts/setup_aliases.sh` to install these aliases automatically.

### Available Aliases

```bash
# Pull latest from GitHub (use on normal WiFi)
gitup

# Deploy code to robot (use on GoPiGo WiFi)
deploypi

# SSH into robot (normal, no GUI)
robopi

# SSH into robot with X11 forwarding (for GUI apps like cv2.imshow)
robopi_x

# Full sync - gitup + deploypi (ONLY when online)
fullsync
```

### Workflow Example

```bash
# Step 1: On normal WiFi - pull latest updates
gitup

# Step 2: Connect to GoPiGo WiFi, then deploy
deploypi

# Step 3: SSH into robot
robopi

# Step 4: Run your code
cd ~/yahooRobot
python3 main.py test mac
```

**💡 Why separate commands?**
- `gitup` needs internet (use on normal WiFi)
- `deploypi` works offline (use on GoPiGo WiFi)
- You might want to pull without deploying, or deploy without pulling

**📺 GUI Applications (X11 Forwarding)**

For apps that show windows (like `cv2.imshow`), use `robopi_x` instead of `robopi`:

1. **Install XQuartz on Mac** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   brew install --cask xquartz
   ```

2. **Open XQuartz** (keep it running)

3. **Use `robopi_x` for GUI apps:**
   ```bash
   robopi_x                    # SSH with X11 forwarding
   echo $DISPLAY              # Verify (should show localhost:10.0)
   python3 main.py test pi_camera  # Run camera test with GUI
   ```

Windows will appear on your Mac via XQuartz.

## 🤖 Robot Commands

### Run the Robot

```bash
# Run robot (default)
python3 main.py run

# Run in simulation mode (no hardware required)
python3 main.py run --simulate

# Run with debug logging
python3 main.py run --debug

# Start web interface
python3 main.py run --webui

# Combine options
python3 main.py run --simulate --debug
```

**Backward Compatibility:** The old-style commands still work:
```bash
python3 main.py --simulate
python3 main.py --debug
python3 main.py --webui
```

---

## 🧪 Test Commands

### List Available Tests

```bash
python3 main.py test --list
```

### Run Tests

```bash
# Run gesture detection test (Mac)
python3 main.py test mac

# Run camera test
python3 main.py test camera

# Run gesture test (alias for mac)
python3 main.py test gesture

# Run Pi camera test (on Raspberry Pi)
python3 main.py test pi_camera
```

### Story & Feature Tests

These are standalone scripts for testing major features and user stories.

**Workflow:**
1.  `(On Dev Machine)` Pull latest code: `gitup`
2.  `(On Dev Machine)` Deploy to robot: `deploypi`
3.  `(On Dev Machine)` SSH into robot: `robopi`
4.  `(On Robot)` Navigate to project directory: `cd ~/yahooRobot`
5.  `(On Robot)` Run the desired test script.

#### Story 1.2: Test Linear Movement

This test validates the robot's ability to drive in a straight line.

```bash
# Run on the robot (requires hardware)
python3 tests/test_linear_movement.py

# Run in simulation on any machine
python3 tests/test_linear_movement.py --simulate
```
> **Note:** When running on hardware, the test will pause and ask for confirmation before starting. It will also require you to manually measure the distance traveled at the end.

#### Story 1.3: Test Precise Turns

This test validates the robot's ability to perform accurate in-place turns using IMU feedback.

```bash
# Run on the robot (requires hardware and IMU)
python3 tests/test_turns.py

# Run in simulation on any machine
python3 tests/test_turns.py --simulate
```

**What it tests:**
- 90° right turn (within ±3° tolerance)
- 90° left turn (within ±3° tolerance)
- 180° turn (within ±3° tolerance)

> **Note:** When running on hardware, the test will pause before each turn and ask for confirmation. Make sure the robot has clear space to rotate in place without hitting obstacles.

#### Story 1.4: Execute Full Row Traversal

This script tests the robot's ability to navigate to all configured desks and return to origin.

```bash
# Run on the robot (requires hardware)
python3 scripts/run_row_traversal.py

# Run in simulation on any machine
python3 scripts/run_row_traversal.py --simulate
```

#### Stories 2.1 + 2.2: Desk-Centric Polling System

This test validates the person detection and desk polling systems working together.

```bash
# Run on the robot (requires hardware, camera, and IMU)
python3 tests/test_desk_polling.py

# Run in simulation on any machine
python3 tests/test_desk_polling.py --simulate
```

**What it tests:**
- Person detector (back-view optimized for detecting students from behind)
- Desk poller initialization and configuration
- Full polling scan (robot turns to face each desk sequentially)
- Detection queue creation (occupied desks found during scan)
- Summary statistics generation

**On hardware, this will:**
- Turn the robot to face each desk at configured scan angles
- Capture camera frame at each desk
- Run person detection using MediaPipe Pose (shoulder visibility)
- Build a list of occupied desk IDs
- Provide LED feedback (green blink when person detected)

> **Note:** When running on hardware, ensure the robot has clear space to rotate in place and that the camera has a clear view of each desk. The robot will turn approximately ±66° during the scan.

#### Story 3.2: Collection Mission

This executes the full paper collection workflow.

```bash
# Quick test - collect from 1 desk, no timer
python3 scripts/run_collection_mission.py --limit-desks 1

# Test with 2 desks
python3 scripts/run_collection_mission.py --limit-desks 2

# Full mission - all 4 desks, start immediately
python3 scripts/run_collection_mission.py

# Full mission with 10-minute countdown timer
python3 scripts/run_collection_mission.py --timer 10
```

**What it does:**
1. Optional countdown timer (e.g., 10 minutes for students to complete work)
2. Navigates to each desk in sequence along the row
3. At each desk:
   - Turns left 90° to face the desk
   - Waits for student to insert paper (press ENTER)
   - Scans paper and saves with desk_id + timestamp
   - Turns back to continue to next desk
4. Shows collection statistics at end

**Setup:**
- Position robot in front of Desk 1, facing along the row (parallel to desks)
- Same positioning as row traversal test

**Files saved to:** `collected_papers/desk_N_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt`

> **Note:** Robot uses hardcoded distances between desks (52cm, 238cm, 52cm). Does 180° turn after Desk 2 to reverse direction.

## 📝 Adding New Tests

To add a new test, update the `test_scripts` dictionary in `main.py`:

```python3
test_scripts = {
    'mac': 'tests/test_gesture_mac.py',
    'camera': 'scripts/camera_test.py',
    'gesture': 'tests/test_gesture_mac.py',
    'your_new_test': 'path/to/your_test.py',  # Add here
}
```

Then run it with:
```bash
python3 main.py test your_new_test
```
