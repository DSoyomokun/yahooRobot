# Yahoo Robot Classroom Simulator

A web-based classroom robot simulator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This simulator demonstrates autonomous robot behavior in a classroom environment for paper distribution, test collection, and student assistance.

## Features

### ðŸ¤– Robot Capabilities
- **Autonomous Navigation**: A* pathfinding algorithm for optimal obstacle avoidance
- **Paper Distribution**: Efficient route through all 20 desks
- **Test Collection**: Automated test gathering and grading
- **Hand Raise Response**: Manual response to student requests
- **Collision Avoidance**: Prevents robot from going through desks
- **Speed Control**: Adjustable simulation speed (1x to 4x)

### ðŸŽ¯ Classroom Management
- **20 Student Desks**: Arranged in a realistic classroom layout
- **Dock Station**: Robot's home base for charging and task completion
- **Student Interaction**: Click desks to raise hands for assistance
- **Grade Management**: Automatic test grading with detailed reports
- **Status Monitoring**: Real-time robot position and task tracking

### ðŸŽ® Controls
- **Pass Out Papers**: Distributes papers to all desks needing them
- **Collect Papers**: Gathers completed tests from all desks
- **Toggle Hand Scanning**: Responds to raised hands (manual mode)
- **Speed Controls**: Increase/decrease simulation speed
- **Grade Report**: View detailed grading results

## Route Optimization

The robot follows an optimized route for maximum efficiency:

**Paper Distribution & Collection Route:**
```
D16 â†’ D11 â†’ D06 â†’ D01 â†’ D02 â†’ D07 â†’ D12 â†’ D17 â†’ D18 â†’ D13 â†’ 
D08 â†’ D03 â†’ D04 â†’ D09 â†’ D14 â†’ D19 â†’ D20 â†’ D15 â†’ D10 â†’ D05 â†’ Dock
```

## Technical Implementation

### Pathfinding
- **A* Algorithm**: Optimal pathfinding around obstacles
- **Collision Detection**: Prevents robot from entering desk areas
- **Edge Positioning**: Robot stops at desk edges, not inside desks

### Task Management
- **Queue System**: Efficient task queuing and execution
- **State Management**: Tracks robot status, desk states, and student needs
- **Interference Prevention**: Prevents task conflicts during execution

### User Interface
- **Grid-Based Layout**: Visual representation of classroom
- **Real-Time Updates**: Live robot position and status updates
- **Interactive Controls**: Click-to-raise hands, button controls
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Getting Started

1. **Open the Simulator**:
   ```bash
   # Serve the files locally
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   # Or use any web server
   ```

2. **Access the Simulator**:
   - Open `http://localhost:8000/sim/index.html` in your browser

3. **Basic Usage**:
   - Click desks to raise hands (turns red)
   - Use control buttons to start robot tasks
   - Monitor robot status in the control panel
   - Adjust speed as needed

## Classroom Scenarios

### Paper Distribution
1. Click "Pass Out Papers"
2. Robot follows optimized route
3. Delivers papers to desks needing them
4. Returns to dock when complete

### Test Collection
1. Click "Collect Papers" 
2. Robot visits all desks with completed tests
3. Automatically grades tests
4. Returns to dock with collected tests

### Student Assistance
1. Click desks to raise hands (red indicators)
2. Click "Toggle Hand Scanning"
3. Robot visits all raised hands
4. Clears red indicators as it assists students

## Configuration

### Desk Layout
- 20 desks arranged in 4 rows of 5 desks each
- Each desk is a 4x4 cell area
- Robot stops at desk edges (not inside desks)

### Robot Specifications
- **Size**: Larger than original for better visibility
- **Speed**: Adjustable from 1x to 4x simulation speed
- **Navigation**: A* pathfinding with collision avoidance
- **Positioning**: Stops at desk front edges for realistic behavior
